# CPTS437_project

This project explores the results of different reinforcement machine learning algorithms on the Lunar Lander environment in OpenAIâ€™s Gymnasium Python Library. We compared the learning abilities of four algorithms on the environment including Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 

The code for each of these algorithms can be found in their corresponding folder.
